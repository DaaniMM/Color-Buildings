This is a project of FreeCodeCamp.
I did this and tried to do for myself later.
The principal "difficult" of this project is that there are a lot of buildings, and each one has got a different style.
Changing the size of the window will make the lights turn off.

This is one of my firsts projects.

Happy coding!!
